    "# Text Classification Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Text Classification Challenge! In this task, you will develop a machine learning model to classify IMDb movie reviews into positive or negative sentiments. The challenge is designed to help you demonstrate your skills in natural language processing (NLP) and your ability to work with state-of-the-art transformer models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to build a text classification model that accurately predicts whether a given movie review expresses a positive or negative sentiment. Sentiment analysis is a critical task in NLP with applications in marketing, customer feedback, social media monitoring, and more. Accurately classifying sentiments can provide valuable insights into customer opinions and help businesses make data-driven decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Task is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding customer sentiment through text data is crucial for businesses and organizations to respond effectively to customer needs and preferences. By automating the sentiment analysis process, companies can efficiently analyze vast amounts of data, identify trends, and make informed strategic decisions. For this challenge, we will use the IMDb dataset, a widely-used benchmark in sentiment analysis, to train and evaluate our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for this challenge is the IMDb movie reviews dataset, which contains 50,000 reviews labeled as either positive or negative. This dataset is balanced, with an equal number of positive and negative reviews, making it ideal for training and evaluating sentiment analysis models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Columns:**\n",
    "  - `review`: The text of the movie review.\n",
    "  - `sentiment`: The sentiment label (`positive` or `negative`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The IMDb dataset provides a real-world scenario where understanding sentiment can offer insights into public opinion about movies, directors, and actors, as well as broader trends in the entertainment industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers have revolutionized NLP by allowing models to consider the context of a word based on surrounding words, enabling better understanding and performance on various tasks, including sentiment analysis. Their ability to transfer learning from massive datasets and adapt to specific tasks makes them highly effective for text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "You are required to implement a transformer-based model for sentiment classification on the IMDb dataset. Follow the steps below to complete the challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**\n",
    "   - Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand its structure.\n",
    "   - Preprocess the data by cleaning text, encoding labels, and splitting into training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Implementation:**\n",
    "   - Implement a transformer-based model for sentiment classification. You should consider writing Transformer blocks from scratch.\n",
    "   - Implement data loaders and training loops using a deep learning framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training and Evaluation:**\n",
    "   - Train your model and optimize hyperparameters for the best performance.\n",
    "   - Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Documentation:**\n",
    "   - Document your approach, experiments, and results.\n",
    "   - Discuss any challenges faced and propose potential improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Prediction and Inference:**\n",
    "    - Implement a function that takes a movie review as input and predicts the sentiment (positive or negative).\n",
    "    - Test the function with custom reviews and display the predicted sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Model Deployment:**\n",
    "    - Save the trained model and any other necessary files.\n",
    "    - Prepare the model for deployment (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI).\n",
    "    - Prepare a basic front-end interface for the deployed model.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Submission:**\n",
    "    - Create a GitHub repository for your code.\n",
    "    - Write a detailed README.md file with instructions on how to train, evaluate, and use the model.\n",
    "    - Include a summary of your approach and the results in the README file.\n",
    "    - Your code should be well-documented and reproducible.\n",
    "    - Your repository should include a notebook showcasing the complete process, including data loading, preprocessing, model implementation, training, and evaluation.\n",
    "    - Apart from the notebook, you should also have all the codes in .py files so that it can be easily integrated with the API.\n",
    "    - You submission should also include a python script for the API.\n",
    "    - Your submission should also include a basic front-end for the deployed model.\n",
    "    - Submit the GitHub repository link.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, follow the structure provided in this notebook, complete each step, and explore additional techniques to enhance your model's performance. Make sure to document your findings and prepare a comprehensive report on your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck, and welcome to RealAI!\n"

    "This section provides a detailed explanation of the techniques used for model training and the hyperparameter tuning strategies employed to maximize accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Data Preprocessing Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text Cleaning Pipeline\n",
    "Our preprocessing pipeline applies several transformations to clean and normalize the text data:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Technique | Purpose | Implementation |\n",
    "|-----------|---------|----------------|\n",
    "| **Lowercasing** | Reduces vocabulary size, ensures consistency | `text.lower()` |\n",
    "| **HTML Tag Removal** | Removes web artifacts from scraped data | `re.sub(r'<[^>]+>', '', text)` |\n",
    "| **URL Removal** | Eliminates non-sentiment content | `re.sub(r'http\\S+\\|www\\S+\\|https\\S+', '', text)` |\n",
    "| **Special Character Removal** | Keeps only meaningful words | `re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\\s]', '', text)` |\n",
    "| **Whitespace Normalization** | Ensures consistent tokenization | `' '.join(text.split())` |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokenization Strategy\n",
    "- **Word-level tokenization** for simplicity and interpretability\n",
    "- **Frequency-based vocabulary** with top 25,000 words\n",
    "- **Special tokens:** `<PAD>` (padding) and `<UNK>` (unknown words)\n",
    "- **Fixed sequence length:** 256 tokens with truncation/padding\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Model Architecture Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Transformer Encoder Only?\n",
    "- Sentiment classification is a **sequence classification task**, not sequence-to-sequence\n",
    "- Encoder-only is more **computationally efficient** for classification\n",
    "- **Bidirectional attention** considers context from both directions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Choices Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "| Component | Value | Rationale |\n",
    "|-----------|-------|-----------|\n",
    "| `d_model = 256` | Embedding dimension | Balance between expressiveness and computational cost |\n",
    "| `num_heads = 8` | Attention heads | Allows learning different relationship patterns simultaneously |\n",
    "| `num_layers = 4` | Encoder layers | Sufficient depth for text patterns without overfitting |\n",
    "| `d_ff = 512` | Feed-forward dim | 2x d_model (standard transformer ratio) |\n",
    "| `GELU activation` | Non-linearity | Smoother gradients than ReLU, better for transformers |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "**Positional Encoding:**\n",
    "- Sinusoidal encodings from \"Attention is All You Need\" paper\n",
    "- Allows understanding of word order without learned parameters\n",
    "- Generalizes to varying sequence lengths\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Head Self-Attention:**\n",
    "- 8 parallel attention heads\n",
    "- Each head learns different aspects of word relationships\n",
    "- Scaled dot-product attention for stability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Global Average Pooling:**\n",
    "- Aggregates sequence representation into fixed-size vector\n",
    "- Uses masked pooling to ignore padding tokens\n",
    "- More robust than using just the first or last token\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Optimization Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "### AdamW Optimizer\n",
    "```python\n",
    "optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-4, weight_decay=0.01)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **AdamW** decouples weight decay from gradient updates for better regularization\n",
    "- **Learning rate (1e-4):** Conservative rate for stable transformer training\n",
    "- **Weight decay (0.01):** L2 regularization to prevent overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cosine Annealing Learning Rate Scheduler\n",
    "```python\n",
    "scheduler = CosineAnnealingLR(optimizer, T_max=epochs, eta_min=1e-6)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Gradually decreases learning rate following a cosine curve\n",
    "- **High initial LR** for faster learning, **low final LR** for fine-tuning\n",
    "- Helps converge to better local minima than constant LR\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Clipping\n",
    "```python\n",
    "torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Prevents exploding gradients during training\n",
    "- Essential for stable transformer training\n",
    "- Max norm of 1.0 is a proven threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Regularization Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "| Technique | Location | Value | Purpose |\n",
    "|-----------|----------|-------|---------|\n",
    "| **Dropout** | Throughout model | 0.1 | Prevents co-adaptation of neurons |\n",
    "| **Layer Normalization** | After each sub-layer | - | Stabilizes activations |\n",
    "| **Weight Decay** | AdamW optimizer | 0.01 | L2 regularization |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dropout Locations:\n",
    "- After positional encoding\n",
    "- In attention weight computation\n",
    "- In feed-forward networks\n",
    "- Before classification head\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Hyperparameter Tuning Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters Explored and Final Values\n",
    "\n",
    "| Hyperparameter | Values Tested | Final Value | Impact on Performance |\n",
    "|----------------|---------------|-------------|----------------------|\n",
    "| Learning Rate | 1e-3, 5e-4, 1e-4, 5e-5 | **1e-4** | Higher caused instability, lower was too slow |\n",
    "| Batch Size | 16, 32, 64 | **32** | Balance between noise and memory |\n",
    "| d_model | 128, 256, 512 | **256** | Best accuracy without overfitting |\n",
    "| num_layers | 2, 4, 6 | **4** | Diminishing returns beyond 4 |\n",
    "| num_heads | 4, 8, 16 | **8** | Best attention distribution |\n",
    "| Dropout | 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 | **0.1** | Balanced regularization |\n",
    "| max_length | 128, 256, 512 | **256** | Captures most content efficiently |\n",
    "| Epochs | 5, 10, 15 | **10** | Convergence without overfitting |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuning Methodology:\n",
    "1. Started with baseline hyperparameters from transformer literature\n",
    "2. Used **validation accuracy** as primary metric\n",
    "3. Applied **grid search** for critical parameters (LR, batch size)\n",
    "4. Fine-tuned architecture parameters (layers, heads, dimensions)\n",
    "5. Selected checkpoint with **best validation performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Training Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics Tracked Per Epoch:\n",
    "- Training loss and accuracy\n",
    "- Validation loss and accuracy  \n",
    "- Precision, recall, and F1 score\n",
    "- Learning rate schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Model Selection:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if val_acc > best_val_accuracy:\n",
    "    best_val_accuracy = val_acc\n",
    "    torch.save(model_checkpoint, 'best_model.pth')\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Only saves when validation accuracy improves\n",
    "- Prevents saving overfit models from later epochs\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Key Training Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Warm-up Needed:** Conservative LR (1e-4) provided stable training without warm-up\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Batch Size 32:** Good balance between gradient stability and GPU memory\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **256 Token Length:** Captures majority of review content efficiently\n",
    "\n",
